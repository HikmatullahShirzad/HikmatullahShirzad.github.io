        <p>
            Use the <b>Left</b> and <b>Right</b> arrow keys to move your blue rectangle (paddle) at the bottom.<br>
            Try to catch the green circle (ball) with your paddle.<br>
            For bonus points, catch the red triangle (bonus)!<br>
            Each time you catch the ball, you get 1 point.<br>
            If you miss the ball, your score resets to 0.<br>
            Try to get as high a score as possible!
        </p>
        <p>Press <b>Space</b> to restart the game at any time.</p>
